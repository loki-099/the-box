            The Box is a passion project of mine that showcases the journals I authored. Its objective is to keep me active at all times and to constantly practice my design and web development abilities as I learn. I understand that the design and user experience are not optimal but I promise that it will improve with time. 
            
            Although the content may not be relevant to you, I promised that you would acquire some insight from my perspective. We all have distinct journeys and paths to take, but we are united because we all want to succeed.
